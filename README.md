# Python File Converter

## Description

An interactive command line program that is used to convert file types. The program will loop through any files that have been added
to the "input" folder, ask you to select your desired conversions (example: MOV -> GIF), and create the resulting files in the
"output" folder.

The program is currently a WIP, and version 0.1.0 is yet to release.
